# Unit Testing Frameworks

## Catch
Catch appears to be a very easy to setup, and well respected unit testing
framework in C++.

A catch.hpp files is included in this repository, but it may not get maintained.
It is a much better idea to use the official catch header files.

## TODO

* Link the README.md to the official catch2 project
* Add examples to the Catch section about how to use Catch in the GCSDD Program
