# Common Build Tools for UWB GCSDD

This project is a first attempt at building some common tools for working with
c++ files in the GCSDD program at UW Bothell.

Why solve build-tool challenges once for each student, when we can share
knowledge to make better configs, documentation, etc.

Currently this project has a couple sections, but hopefully it will grow as
people add and maintain various configurations that they need for their own
setups.
