# Makefiles

This section needs work! The Makefile is a first pass that builds with out-of
source object files. It also uses a src directory and a dist directory which
may or may not be what we want for our classes.

### ToDo

* Better documentation of the Makefile
* Better makefile that matches course standards
* find a way to make for different courses (like 'make css501')
* Turn the source attribution link into a MD link
* add the source attribution to the actual makefile

### Source Attribution
